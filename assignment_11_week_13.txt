This assignment is based on topics covered in week 13 (Chapter 23).
Please submit your own work on time. You will NOT get credit if you submit the assignment after the due date.   
Note that the completed assignment should be submitted in .txt format only.
If you think that your answer needs explanation to get credit then please write it down.  
If you have any questions about the assignment, then post a topic on the Sakai forum to discuss that problem.

(1) What is a DMZ (demilitarized zone)? Choose all that apply.
a) it is another name for a firewall
b) it is a portion of a network that separates a purely internal network from an external 
    network
c) it is a router that bypasses an internal network
ANS:b


(2) The way that the Drib Corporation moves data from one class to another is best 
      described by which one of the following principles?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:f


(3) The firewalls are configured using configuration files. The only packets that are 
       let through are those that are specifically allowed. E.G., there is an entry in the 
       configuration file of the outer firewall that allows a packet coming from the 
       Internet addressed to port 80 to be sent to the DMZ Web Server.
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:b


(4) The fact that developers are not allowed to telecommute, e.g., VPN into the 
       internal network from home, is a violation of which of principle?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:h


(5) The policy and rules of the Drib security policy are available to all employees. In 
       fact, the employees are encouraged to understand them. This is an example of 
       which principle?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:e


(6) The fact that every packet sent from the internal network must go through the 
       inner firewall and every packet coming from the Internet must go through the 
       outer firewall is an example of which one of these principles at work?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:d


(7) At one level, the security of the Drib system is based on how firewalls and 
      access control lists are configured. But this security depends on the correct 
      functioning of the firewall software and the operating system. What principle     
      should the writers of the firewall software follow to minimize the chance that 
      the firewall software will fail to work according to its specification?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:f


(8) Not allowing developers to view customer data is an example of
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:a


(9) What kind of access control policy is implemented in the internal Drib network?
a) discretionary
b) mandatory
c) originator controlled
d) none of the above
ANS:b


(10) The fact that the internal network has to get through both inner and outer 
         firewalls to get to the Internet is an example of which one of these principles?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:f


(11) The four servers in the DMZ zone are all on separate computers. This is an 
       example of which principle?
a) principle of least privilege
b) principle of fail-safe defaults
c) principle of economy of mechanism
d) principle of complete mediation
e) principle of open design
f) principle of separation of privilege
g) principle of least common mechanism
h) principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:g

b) no writes down
c) no reads down
d) no writes up
ANS:d


(14) Briefly argue that the customer service group does not have access to the 
        Web-Clone machine because of confidentiality concerns. (Hint: use Bell-
        LaPadula)
