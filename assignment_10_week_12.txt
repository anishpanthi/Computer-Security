This assignment is based on topics covered in week 12 (Chapter 21 & 22).
Please submit your own work on time. You will NOT get credit if you submit the assignment after the due date.   
Note that the completed assignment should be submitted in .txt format only.
If you think that your answer needs explanation to get credit then please write it down.  
If you have any questions about the assignment, then post a topic on the Sakai forum to discuss that problem.

(1) Security logging is:
a) the recording of events or statistics to provide information about system use and 
    performance
b) the analysis of log records to present information about the system in a clear and 
    understandable manner
c) a crucial part of a database transaction
d) none of the above
ANS:a

(2) Auditing is:
a) the recording of events or statistics to provide information about system use and 
    performance
b) the analysis of log records to present information about the system in a clear and 
    understandable manner
c) a process of securely applying patches to the OS.
d) none of the above
ANS:b

(3) An auditing system contains which of the following components?
a) a logger
b) an analyzer
c) a password checker
d) a notifier
e) a sandbox
ANS:a,b,d

(4) What determines what information is logged by a logger?
a) the needs of the analyzer
b) the needs of the notifier
c) it's up to the implementer as long as the user id and a timestamp is included.
d) the space available in the database.
ANS:a

(5) Log sanitization is
a) removing confidential information from a log before displaying it.
b) making sure that the log file has proper access permissions.
c) removing all log records that are more than x days old.
d) validating the integrity of the log.
ANS:c


(6) Intrusion detection is a form of auditing
a) true
b) false
ANS:a

(7) Does your use of a computer at work or at home follow a statistically predictable 
       pattern? Answer yes or no and write a couple of sentences justifying your 
       answer.
ANS: 

(8) A normal user of a system
a) rarely gets denied access to files
b) rarely runs a program that he/she is denied access to
c) is impossible to distinguish from an attacker
d) never mistypes their password.
ANS:a,b

(9) A virus might cause a program to access files that it doesn't normally access.
a) true
b) false
ANS:a

(10) Which of the following are desirable characteristics of an intrusion detection 
         system?
a) it should minimize false negatives
b) it should maximize false negatives
c) it should minimize false positives
d) it should maximize false positives
e) none of the above
ANS:a

(11) It is not possible for any type of intrusion detection system to detect a zero-
        day attack
a) true
b) false
ANS:a

(12) Consider the following situation at Annapurna (the cafeteria at M.U.M.)
        A diner must show a badge or purchase a meal before eating at Annapurna.     
        Each diner uses a tray. If the number of trays washed in a day does not equal 
        the number of diners counted by the door checker, then somebody has cheated 
        Annapurna and eaten for free.
        By analogy, this is an example of which of the following:
a) anomaly modelling
b) misuse modelling
c) specification-based modelling
ANS:c

(13) Consider the following policy implemented by Annapurna (the cafeteria at 
        M.U.M.)
        A student usually accesses only the dining room and the dish room. If a student  
        is found in the kitchen this is reported (he/she may be trying to put some 
        chicken in the soup).
        By analogy, this is an example of which of the following:
a) anomaly modelling
b) misuse modelling
c) specification-based modelling
ANS:a

(14) Consider the following information about Annapurna, the cafeteria at MUM.
         From past experience Annapurna has determined that each student on the   
         average drinks one pint of milk per day. Based on this information they budget 
         for X gallons of milk per day. If on some day, all X gallons have been used 
         before the midday meal, there is reason to suspect that someone is stealing 
         milk.
         By analogy, Annapurna is doing what kind of modelling here?
a) anomaly modelling
b) misuse modelling
c) specification-based modeling
ANS:a

(15) Which statistical model is likely to be used to detect someone guessing 
         passwords?
a) threshhold metric
b) statistical moments
c) markov model
ANS:a

(16) Which of the following are phases of intrusion handling?
a) logging
b) auditing
c) recovery
d) making a backup
e) notifying
ANS:c
