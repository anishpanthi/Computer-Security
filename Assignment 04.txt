This assignment is based on topics covered in week 4 (lecture 6 & 7).
Please submit your own work on time.  You'll NOT get credit if you submit the assignment after the due date.
Note that the completed assignment should be submitted in .txt format only.
If you think that your answer needs explanation to get credit then please write it down.
If you've any questions about the assignment, then post a topic on the Sakai forum to discuss that problem.


(1) In a Caesar cipher, the encryption function is the same as the decryption function.
a) True
b) False
ANS:b


(2) Let's say that the plaintext "hello" is enciphered as "zbabh". What kind of cipher is this? (It is one of the three choices given)
a) Substitution
b) Transposition
c) Product (both substitution and transposition)
ANS:c

(3) Rosetta stone is an example of which type of attack?
a) Ciphertext only (have only the ciphertext)
b) Known plaintext (have the ciphertext for a known plaintext)
c) Chosen plaintext (can generate ciphertext for any plaintext)
ANS:b


(4) Which of the following are true about sending a PGP message from Alice to Bob?
a) The plaintext is enciphered with Alice's public key
b) The plaintext is enciphered with Alice's private key
c) The plaintext is enciphered with Bob's public key
d) The plaintext is enciphered with Bob's private key
e) The plaintext is enciphered using a secret key
f) The plaintext is compressed before it is enciphered
g) The plaintext is compressed after it is enciphered
h) The plaintext is signed using Bob's public key
i) The plaintext is signed using Alice's public key
j) The plaintext is signed using Alice's private key
ANS:e,f,j


(5) Briefly describe why a symmetric cipher is never used for a digital signature.
ANS:Among the list of reasons the one is:
The receiver would to have a copy of the key used to encode the hash of the message.

(6) The key MUST be of the same length as that of the message in which cipher technique?
a) Rail-fence
b) Vegenere
c) One Time pad
d) Caesar cipher
ANS:c


(7) What is the most important difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?
ANS:symmetric do have only one key whereas in asymmetric there are two keys one for
encrypting and the other for decrypting.

(8) If I get a message from someone that's encrypted with my public key, then I'm assured about Origin Integrity.
a) True
b) False
ANS:b


(9) In what way does the Electronic Code Book mode of DES behave like a substitution cipher rather than a product cipher?
ANS:Two identical  bits blocks will be encrypted identically.

(10) The cipher text for word “SECURITY” using a rail-fence cipher with a key of 3 is:
a) SUTERYCI
b) SCRTEUIY
c) YTIRUCES
d) UGEWTKVA
ANS:a


(11) Vegenere is a :
a) Substitution cipher
b) Transposition cipher
ANS:a


(12) Keeping the enciphering and deciphering algorithm secret would violate which design principle?
a) Principle of least privilege
b) Principle of fail-safe defaults
c) Principle of open design
d) Principle of complete mediation
e) Principle of separation of privilege
f) Principle of psychological acceptability
g) Principle of least common mechanism
h) Principle of economy of mechanism
ANS:c


(13) Given enough time the private key can be derived from the public key.
a) True
b) False
ANS:a
