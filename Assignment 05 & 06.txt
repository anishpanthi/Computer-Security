This assignment is based on topics covered in week 5 and 6 (lectures 8 & 9).
Please submit your own work on time.  You'll NOT get credit if you submit the assignment after the due date.   
Note that the completed assignment should be submitted in .txt format only.
If you think that your answer needs explanation to get credit then please write it down.  
If you’ve any questions about the assignment, then post a topic on the Sakai forum to discuss that problem.

(1) Kerberos was a mythical three headed dog that guarded the gates of hell. What are the 3 "heads" of the Kerberos protocol?
a) Authentication server (which requires a password)
b) Internal firewall
c) Ticket-granting server
d) Client machine
e) Target server (e.g. a print server which requires a ticket to use)
ANS: a,c,e

(2) What is a weakness of the Needham-Schroeder protocol?
a) The clocks of the sender and receiver machines must be kept synchronized
b) A predictable random number generator will allow an intruder to guess the session key
c) A predictable random number generator will allow an intruder to guess the interchange key
d) The session key doesn't have enough bits
e) The interchange key doesn't have enough bits.
ANS:b

(3) During key exchange which of the following must be kept secret.
a) How the key was generated
b) The key itself
c) The protocol used to exchange the key
d) Who the sender is
e) Who the receiver is
ANS:b

(4) It is crucial that no attacker is eavesdropping during key exchange.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(5) Which, in general, has a longer lifespan: a session key or an interchange key?
a) Session key
b) Interchange key
c) Lifetime of both are the same
ANS:b

(6) Which of the following protocols require clock synchronization between the participants?
a) Needham-Schroeder
b) Denning-Sacco
c) Otway-Rees
d) Kerberos
e) None of the above
ANS:b,d

(7) Lets say that I want my bank to wire you $1000. I encipher a message containing this request to the bank as follows:
   	1. First generate a random session key
   	2. Then encipher the session key with the bank's public key
   	3. Then encipher the message with the session key
   	4. Finally send the enciphered message and enciphered session key to the bank
      When the bank gets the enciphered message, it does the following:
   	1. Deciphers the enciphered session key using its private key
   	2. Uses the session key to decipher the message
   	3. Reads the plaintext of the message telling it to send you $1000
   	4. Sends you the money
     This protocol is seriously flawed. It's most serious failing is that it doesn't support which one of the following? Briefly explain why.
a) Confidentiality
b) Origin integrity
c) Data integrity
d) Availability
ANS:b

(8) Kerberos uses public key cryptography to exchange the session key between the authenticating server and the ticket granting server.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(9) Which of the following are true statements about a digital signature?
a) Part of the procedure of creating a digital signature is to hash the message using a cryptographic checksum function.
b) A message that is digitally signed must be encrypted before it is signed.
c) Part of the procedure of creating a digital signature is to encrypt the message hash using the private key.
d) Part of the procedure of creating a digital signature is to encrypt the message hash using the public key.
e) A digital signature helps assure the integrity of the message.
ANS:a,c,e

(10) What is a weakness of the Denning-Sacco key exchange protocol?
a) The clocks of the sender and receiver machines must be kept synchronized
b) A predictable random number generator will allow an intruder to guess the session key
c) A predictable random number generator will allow an intruder to guess the interchange key
d) The session key doesn't have enough bits
e) The interchange key doesn't have enough bits.
ANS:a

(11) Which of the following are acceptable ways to get the public key of a CA?
a) From a list of trusted root certification authorities that ships with a browser
b) From an unsolicited promotional email sent by the CA
c) From a certificate chain
d) From a flash drive mailed to you by the CA after they have validated your identity.
e) From the home page of the CA
ANS:a,c,d

(12) In Kerberos, the print server shares a key with the authenticating server.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(13) Which of the following are true about a certificate?
a) It associates an identity with a public key
b) It contains the private key to use to decipher messages enciphered with the public key
c) It is signed by the public key of a certifying authority.
d) It is signed by the private key of a certifying authority.
e) The content of a certificate is enciphered using the private key of a certifying authority
ANS:a,d

(14) A Certifying Authority (CA) always needs to be online to provide certificates to its clients.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(15) The SSL protocol uses the private key of the browser to encrypt the session key.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(16) Since the domain names https://www.mumde.net and https://mumde.net both are mapped to the same IP address, both are treated identically by a browser.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(17) When you get a certificate from a CA you must provide the CA with both your public and your private key.
a) true
b) false
ANS:b

(18) A PGP certificate can have more than one digital signature
a) true
b) false
ANS:a

(19) Let's say that your Student ID was a 20 digit random number instead of in the form of 000-98-xxxx. This was done to increase security by making it more difficult for somebody to guess your SID. This is a violation of which one of the following principles?
a) Principle of least privilege
b) Principle of fail-safe defaults
c) Principle of economy of mechanism
d) Principle of complete mediation
e) Principle of open design
f) Principle of separation of privilege
g) Principle of least common mechanism
h) Principle of psychological acceptability
ANS:h

(20) Let eCA be the public key of a CA, dCA be the private key of that CA and eJack be the public key of Jack.  How would a certificate issued by CA for Jack look like?
ANS:Jack,Jack's address,ejack,issuer,serial#,expriation date.

(21) If you use a CA, there is no single point of failure.
a) true
b) false
ANS:a

(22) Explain any 2 ways by which a Trudy can compromise the verification of a certificate.
ANS:a)Steal the private key of the CA.She can use it to sign any certificate. If CA's private key 
gets stolen,every certificate that was assigned by it should be revoked.
b)Trudy could steal somebody's identity and get a certificate using that identity.

(23) What is the importance of using Certificate chains?
ANS:A chain is useful if alice doesn't know the CA that signed the certificate that contains Bob's public key.
