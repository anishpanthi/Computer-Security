If you’ve any questions about the assignment, then post a topic on the Sakai forum to discuss that problem.

(1) You should have a high degree of trust in applets which are Java programs that are downloaded from the Internet by the browser and run on your machine. The browser runs them in what is called a sandbox, which restricts what the applet can do on your machine.
a) yes
b) no
c) depends whether I have the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
ANS:C

(2) Create an XML document that represents the following information:

The role named "student" has read access to file1, append access to file2 and read/write access to file4. The role named "intern" has write access to file1 and read/write/execute access to file3.

Here is how the roles are distributed:

   1. joe is both a student and an intern
   2. jack is a student
   3. pat is a student
   4. kathy is an intern

a) mandatory access control
b) discretionary access control
c) originator access control

read
read,write,execute,own
jill
append

(5) Consider the following access control matrix:


file1
file2
file3
file4
bob
read,write,own
read
read,write,execute,own

jill
append
read,own
execute
read,write,execute,own

 Which of the following statements are true about this access control matrix.
a) bob and jill can read file4
b) bob can write file3
c) some objects are owned by more than one subject
d) file3 is a program
e) all subjects can write to the objects they own.
ANS:b,d
        file1            file2      file3                     file 4
bob   read,write,own     read      read,write,execute,own
jill  append             read,own      execute                  read,write,execute,own

Bob can write file3, file3 is executable

(6) Wood mentions the following security policy item: Power conditioning equipment required for all PCs Policy: All PCs must be outfitted with either uninterruptable power supply systems, electrical power filters, or surge suppressor which have been approved the information systems department. This is a means to assure: 
a) confidentiality
b) integrity
c) availability
ANS:C

(7) Here are six policies from Wood regarding computer usage. Choose the 3 that are most appropriate for the M.U.M. computer lab. 
(a) Games may not be used on any computers that use the M.U.M. LAN. Policy: Since games can introduce viruses, take up system resources and are generally a distraction from the main purpose of the M.U.M. LAN which is to promote Computer Science education, no games may be stored on or used by any computer hooked up to the M.U.M LAN.
(b) No personal use of the Internet Policy: M.U.M. computers must be used for educational purposes only related to the courses and job search requirements of the students. Personal use (e.g., reading the news or downloading videos) is allowed only by special permission of the department manager.
(c) Personal use of computers only after class time. Policy: M.U.M. encourages students to explore the Internet, but if this exploration is for personal use, it must be done on personal time after daily homework has been been completed. Likewise, for news feeds, discussion groups, games and other activities which cannot be definitively linked to an individual's educational responsibilities must be performed on personal time.
(d) Granting user IDs to outsiders Policy: Individuals who are not M.U.M. faculty, staff or students must not be granted a user ID or otherwise to use the M.U.M computer lab unless written approval of a department head has first been obtained. This includes giving a non-M.U.M. person your user ID and password.
(e) Disclaimer of responsibility for damage to data and programs. Policy: M.U.M. uses access controls and other security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information handled by computers and communication systems. In keeping with these objectives, management maintains the authority to: (1) restrict or revoke any user's privileges, (2) Inspect, copy, remove, or otherwise alter any data, program, or other system resource that may undermine these objectives. (3) Take any other steps deemed necessary to manage and protect its information systems. This authority may be exercised with or without notice to the involved users. M.U.M. disclaims any responsibility for loss or damage to data or software that results from its efforts to meet these security objectives.
(f) Information ownership must be assigned Policy: Management must clearly specify in writing the assignment of ownership responsibilities for databases, master files, and other shared collections of information. These statements must also indicate the individuals who have been granted authority to originate, modify, or delete specific types of information found in these collections.
ANS: a,c,d,e

(8) The textbook has a reference to an earlier version of Charles Cresson Wood's book Information Security Policies made Easy . The latest version of this book costs $795.00. Why so much? Because it contains 842 items that a company or university could include in their security policy. All you have to do is copy his words. This will definitely save a company who wants to be sure that they don't overlook anything a lot of money. 
The following questions lists 8 login related security policy items from that book. Your job is to select the 3 ones that would most appropriate for a security policy for the M.U.M. computer lab. Hint: students will probably choose different items but some items are just too strict for an academic computer lab and you will lose points if you choose them. 
(a) Pronounceable system-generated passwords Policy: So that users may more easily remember them, and so that users will not need to write them down, all system-generated passwords for end-users must be pronounceable (e.g., brom_howser)
(b) Periodic forced password changes Policy: All users must be automatically forced to change their passwords at least once every ninety(90) days.
(c) Assignment of expired passwords Policy: The initial passwords issued by a security administrator must be valid only for the involved user's first on-line session. At that time, the user must be forced to choose another password before any other work can be done.
(d) Use of duress passwords Policy: Whenever system access to a particularly valuable or sensitive data is given to a user, the user must be given two passwords: a regular password and a duress password. The duress password is used to covertly signal the system that this user is being pressured to log on. Duress passwords are special passwords used only in those circumstances where an alarm should be triggered, but where the user's safety may be jeopardized if the bad guys forcing the user to log on know that an alarm has been triggered.
(e) Requirement for different passwords on different systems. Policy: To prevent the compromise of multiple systems, computer users must employ different passwords on each of the systems to which they have been granted access. For example, the NT login and the password used to connect to the SMTP server or POP server for email.
(f) Prohibition of multiple simultaneous login sessions Policy: Unless special permission has been granted by the system manager (e.g. Payman), computer systems must not allow any user to conduct multiple simultaneous on-line sessions.
(g) Automatic log off process Policy: If there has been no activity on a PC for more than 10 minutes, the system must automatically blank the screen and suspend the session. Re-establishment of the session must take place only after the user has provided the proper password.
(h) Must log off if leaving computer Policy: If the computer system to which they are connected contains sensitive or valuable information, users must not leave their PC unattended without first logging out.
ANS:a,b,c,f,g,h

a) read
b) write
c) both

(15) Wood mentions the following two policies:
No read up permissions to access sensitive information Policy: Workers who have been authorized to view information classified at a certain level must be permitted to access only the information at this level and at less sensitive levels 
No write down permissions to access sensitive information Policy: Workers must never be authorized to move information classified at a certain sensitivity level to a less sensitive level unless this action is a formal part of an approved declassification process. 
Which access control model would cover the above two policy items? 
a) Bell-LaPadula
b) Role-Based Access Control Model
c) Access Control Model
d) None of the above
